# Rust Learning Journey

A repository to track my journey learning Rust, following "Algorithmic Thinking" by Daniel Zingaro and preparing for Advent of Code 2024.

## Learning Path

### Week 1 (Nov 11-17): Fundamentals
- [ ] Basic syntax and concepts
- [ ] Ownership and borrowing
- [ ] Structs and enums
- [ ] Collections (Vec, HashMap)
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] First algorithm: Hash Tables

### Week 2 (Nov 18-24): Deep Dive & Algorithms
- [ ] Complete hash table implementation
- [ ] Trees and recursion
- [ ] Dynamic Programming basics

### Week 3 (Nov 25-Dec 1): Advanced Algorithms & AoC Prep
- [ ] Graph algorithms
- [ ] BFS/DFS implementations
- [ ] Advent of Code preparation
